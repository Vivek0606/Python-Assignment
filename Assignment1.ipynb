    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "--> The purpose of Python's OOP, is to organize code in a way that makes it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "In OOP, code is structured around objects, which are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors. By using classes and objects, we can write code that is more modular, reusable, and easier to understand.\n",
    "Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) \n",
    "Class, Objects, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Data Abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "--> An inheritance search looks for an attribute first in:\n",
    "\n",
    "The instance itself: If the attribute exists in the instance, then it is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class: If the attribute does not exist in the instance, then the interpreter looks for it in the class. If it finds the attribute in the class, then it is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The superclasses: If the attribute does not exist in the instance or the class, then the interpreter looks for it in all the higher superclasses, progressing from left to right (by default). The search stops at the first place the attribute is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "--> To distinguish between a class object and an instance object, we can use the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: A class object is defined using the class keyword and defines the attributes and methods that instances of the class             will have. An instance object is created by calling the class as if it were a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity: A class object has a single identity throughout the lifetime of the program. Multiple instances of the same class can           be created, each with its own identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access: Class objects are used to access class attributes and methods, while instance objects are used to access instance               attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special?\n",
    "--> In Python, the first argument of a class method function is always the instance object that the method is called on, and is conventionally named 'self'. This argument is special because it allows the method to access and manipulate the attributes of the instance.\n",
    "In Python, whatever first variable(argument) you take that will behave as a pointer for any function you write.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "--> __init__ method is nothing but initialization of particular variable to the class. We are just trying to pass the data to the class with the help of init. \n",
    "__init__ is a special method which is first run as soon as the object is created. It is also known as a constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "--> In Python, a class instance is created by calling the class as if it were a function, and passing any required arguments to the class constructor (i.e., the __init__ method). This will create a new instance of the class. Once an instance of the class has been created, it can be used to access the instance's attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "--> In Python, a class is created using the 'class' keyword, followed by the name of the class and a colon. The body of the class, which defines its attributes and methods, is indented under the class declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "--> In Python, a class can inherit from one or more superclasses by listing them in parentheses after the class name in the class definition. The superclasses are also known as the base classes or parent classes of the derived class. \n",
    "For Example:- If we define two classes: 'Animal' and 'Dog'. 'Dog' is a derived class of 'Animal', so we specify 'Animal' as the superclass of 'Dog' by listing it in parentheses after the class name. \n",
